## How it Works

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

The application consists of the following core components:

-   **Authentication (`auth.js`):**
    -   Handles user authentication with Spotify using the OAuth 2.0 flow.
    -   Implements a dedicated login screen that appears before the main content is loaded.
    -   Redirects users to the Spotify login page to grant access to their account.
    -   Retrieves the access token and its expiration time after successful login and stores them in the browser's local storage.
    -   Implements automatic token refresh using a hidden iframe:
        -   A hidden iframe is created and loads the Spotify authorization URL with `show_dialog=false` to attempt silent re-authentication.
        -   If the user is still logged into Spotify and the browser allows it, Spotify redirects back within the iframe without user interaction.
        -   The main app window listens for a message from the iframe containing the new access token.
        -   The access token and expiration time are updated in local storage.
        -   This process is scheduled to run shortly before the current token expires.
    -   Handles session expiration by detecting 401 errors from the Spotify API and displaying a re-authentication modal.
    -   Provides a logout function that clears the stored token and expiration time.

-   **API Interaction (`api.js`):**
    -   Communicates with the Spotify Web API to fetch data and control playback.
    -   Provides functions to:
        -   Get the currently playing song (`getCurrentlyPlaying`).
        -   Play a song (`playSong`).
        -   Pause a song (`pauseSong`).
        -   Skip to the next song (`nextSong`).
        -   Go to the previous song (`prevSong`).
    -   Handles API errors, specifically 401 errors to detect token expiration.

-   **User Interface (`app.js`):**
    -   Manages the UI elements and updates them based on the song data.
    -   Sets the album art as the full-screen background and applies the blur effect.
    -   Dynamically updates the play/pause button icon based on the current playback state.
    -   Implements intelligent polling to update the UI at different intervals depending on whether music is playing or paused.
    -   Handles the display and behavior of the session expiration modal.
    -   Provides a toggle to switch between album art and CD display.
    -   **CD Rotation Synchronization:** The CD rotation animation in `app.js` now uses `requestAnimationFrame` to synchronize the rotation with the screen's refresh rate. This ensures smooth animation regardless of the user's display settings.
    -   Displays placeholder content when no music is playing.
    -   Schedules the token refresh mechanism.
    -   **Hide UI Toggle:** Implements the "Hide UI Toggle" functionality in `app.js`, which adds an event listener to the "Hide UI" button. When clicked, it toggles the `hidden` class on the container with the other UI buttons, effectively hiding or showing them.
    -   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Implements keyboard shortcuts for various actions: Spacebar (Play/Pause), Left Arrow (Previous Song), Right Arrow (Next Song), F (Toggle Fullscreen), H (Toggle Hide UI), and M (Toggle CD View).
    -   **Wake Lock API:**
        -   When a song starts playing, it attempts to acquire a screen wake lock using `navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')`.
        -   If successful, this prevents the screen from turning off or the device from sleeping.
        -   If the request fails, the app continues to function normally but without the wake lock.
        -   The wake lock is released when the user logs out or pauses the music.
    -   **Smart Cursor Hiding:**
        -   Implements an inactivity timer that hides the cursor after 5 seconds of no mouse movement, key presses, or touch events.
        -   The cursor is immediately shown again when any of these events occur.
        -   **Wake Lock Integration:** The cursor hiding functionality is automatically managed based on the Wake Lock state.
            -   When the Wake Lock is active (song playing), the inactivity timer is enabled, hiding the cursor after 5 seconds of inactivity.
            -   When the Wake Lock is not active (no song playing, or Wake Lock request failed), the cursor hiding functionality is still active.
            -   When the wake lock is released the cursor is made visible.
        -   This ensures that the cursor is hidden during playback for a better full-screen experience, but it also works correctly when no song is playing or the Wake Lock is unavailable.

-   **Styling (`style.css`):**
    -   Defines the visual appearance of the application, including layout, colors, typography, and animations.
    -   Creates the full-screen album art display with the blurred background effect.
    -   Styles the control buttons and adds hover effects.
    -   Styles the CD display with a rotation animation.
    -   Creates a dedicated login screen with:
        -   A centered layout with appropriate padding.
        -   A large, all-caps "FULLSCREENIFY" title.
        -   A brief app description.
        -   A pulsating Spotify login button with a subtle glow effect.
        -   A very subtle, animated background gradient.
    -   Styles the session expiration modal.
    -   Ensures responsiveness across different screen sizes.
    -   **Hide UI Toggle Button:** `style.css` defines the styles for the "Hide UI Toggle" button, including its container for the hover effect, its appearance, and the `hidden` class used to control visibility.

## Limitations

-   The automatic token refresh mechanism relies on a hidden iframe and may be affected by browser restrictions or if the user is not logged into Spotify. In such cases, manual re-authentication through the session expiration modal will be required.
-   **Wake Lock API:**
    -   The Wake Lock API is relatively new and might not be supported in all browsers. Check the compatibility table for updates: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen\_Wake\_Lock\_API#browser\_compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API#browser_compatibility)
    -   Browsers might provide users with a way to override or disable wake locks.
    -   The API's behavior might vary slightly across different browsers and devices.
