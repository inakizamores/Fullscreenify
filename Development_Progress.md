# Development Progress: Fullscreenify

## Introduction

This document tracks the development progress of Fullscreenify, a web application providing immersive music visualization for Spotify users. It serves as a comprehensive log of development activities, ensuring transparent progress tracking throughout the project lifecycle.

## Development Approach

Fullscreenify will be developed using an AI-assisted approach:

- **Cursor AI** will handle all code creation and implementation
- The developer will act as a facilitator, following AI instructions for external service integration
- No manual code writing is required from the developer
- The developer will manage accounts, API tokens, and service configurations

This approach allows for rapid development while maintaining high code quality and best practices.

## Project Overview

Fullscreenify displays album artwork of currently playing Spotify tracks in fullscreen mode, with features including:
- Standard album art view and animated CD display option
- Real-time playback controls
- UI customization options
- Spotify OAuth integration
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Required Tools & Services

| Tool/Service | Purpose | Installation/Setup |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Vercel CLI | Deployment and environment management | `npm i -g vercel` |
| Supabase CLI | Database management and local development | `npm i -g supabase` |
| Git/GitHub | Version control and CI/CD integration | Pre-installed or download from github.com |
| Node.js | Runtime environment for development | Download from nodejs.org |
| Spotify Developer Account | API access for music data | Register at developer.spotify.com |
| Cursor AI | Code development and implementation | No installation required |

## Service Integration Plan

### GitHub Integration
- Connect GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments
- Link GitHub repository to Supabase for version control of database migrations
- Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

### Vercel & Supabase Connection
- Set up Vercel integration with Supabase for environment variable synchronization
- Configure Vercel project settings to pull variables from Supabase
- Set up automatic deployment hooks

### Spotify API Configuration
- Register application in Spotify Developer Dashboard
- Configure callback URLs for authentication
- Store API credentials securely in environment variables

## Development Standards & Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules for consistent code style
- Write unit and integration tests for critical components
- Implement proper error handling

### Performance
- Optimize images using Next.js Image component
- Implement code splitting for faster initial load
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

### Security
- Store sensitive information in environment variables
- Implement proper authentication flow with HTTP-only cookies
- Use Next.js API routes to proxy Spotify API requests
- Implement CSRF protection

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Add proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios
